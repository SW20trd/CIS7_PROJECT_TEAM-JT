Case 3 - Vigenere Cipher Decryption
Team JT
Joseph Tolentino

Encryption and decryption program written in C++
User supplied phase and key used for encryption 
same key is used for decryption - outputs during same run of program to confirm original phase is correct
main implementation of program focus is on the ascii table position of letters and formulas Ei = (Pi + Ki) mod 26 for encryption, for decryption we will use Di = (Ei - Ki + 26) mod 26

Running of C++ program: user will be asked to submit their phrase and the key they would like to use for encryption and decryption. The program will then display the encrypted text as well as display the decrypted phase, which should default back to the original phase that was submitted by the user.
